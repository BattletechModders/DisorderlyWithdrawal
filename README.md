# Disorderly Withdrawal

This mod for the [HBS BattleTech](http://battletechgame.com/) provides a more punishing withdrawal experience. In the vanilla game, you click the withdrawal button and you are magically whisked away without so much as a scratch on your paint job. MechWarrior veterans know this is never case; a hot pickup is a dangerous affair that leaves everyone a bit banged up!

Options:

* Heavy Wing: 1-2 turn pickup. 80% Leopard damage. 100,000 maintenance.
* Medium Wing: 2-3 turn pickup. 40% Leopard damage. 70,000 maintenance.
* Light Wing: 3-4 turn pickup. 20% Leopard damage. 30,000 maintenance.
* No Aerospace: 4-5 turn pickup. 100% Leopard damage. 0 maintenance.
