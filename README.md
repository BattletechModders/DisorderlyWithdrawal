# Disorderly Withdrawal

This mod for the [HBS BattleTech](http://battletechgame.com/) provides a more punishing withdrawal experience. In the vanilla game, you click the withdrawal button and you are magically whisked away without so much as a scratch on your paint job. MechWarrior veterans know this is never case; a hot pickup is a dangerous affair that leaves everyone a bit banged up!

Options:

* Heavy Wing: 0-2 turn pickup. 60% Leopard damage. 100,000 maintenance.
* Medium Wing: 1-3 turn pickup. 30% Leopard damage. 50,000 maintenance.
* Light Wing: 2-4 turn pickup. 0% Leopard damage. 50,000 maintenance.
* No Aerospace: 3-6 turn pickup. 100% Leopard damage. 0 maintenance.
