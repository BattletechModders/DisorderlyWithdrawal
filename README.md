# Disorderly Withdrawal

This mod for the [HBS BattleTech](http://battletechgame.com/) provides a more punishing withdrawal experience. In the vanilla game, you click the withdrawal button and you are magically whisked away without so much as a scratch on your paint job. MechWarrior veterans know this is never case; a hot pickup is a dangerous affair that leaves everyone a bit banged up!

# WIP Features
- [ ] Delayed withdrawal; from 2-6 turns when you click the withdrawal button before you are picked up
- [ ] Damage expenses -  you have to pay for dropship repairs. Total enemy damage for 2 turns is calculated and applied. You have to pay the repair bill. 
- [ ] Monthly expenses - pay for aerospace support to have quicker pickups
